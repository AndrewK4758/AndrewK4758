# Hello!!!

My name is Andrew Klapper. While running a succesful freight brokerage, in 2019 I decided to learn how to design a website for myself. As with most, I started with GoDaddy, Squarespace, WordPress and was happy but not overly impressed with what I was able to do with a free tier account. I decided to take matters into my own hands and learn how to build my own website. This was the start of an entirely new chapter of my life. After falling in love with the development process, I decided, in 2021, to sell my business and start learning web developemt full time. It is now July 2024 (at time of writing) and I feel I am ready to embark on the first job journey. Below is a short description of my repositories, skills, community envolvement, and personal info.
