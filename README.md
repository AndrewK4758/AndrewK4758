# Hello!!!

My name is Andrew Klapper. While running a succesful freight brokerage, in 2019 I decided to learn how to design a website for myself. As with most, I started with GoDaddy, Squarespace, WordPress and was happy but not overly impressed with what I was able to do with a free tier account. I decided to take matters into my own hands and learn how to build my own website. This was the start of an entirely new chapter of my life. After falling in love with the development process, I decided, in 2021, to sell my business and start learning web developemt full time. It is now July 2024 (at time of writing) and I feel I am ready to embark on the first job journey. Below is a short description of my repositories, skills, community envolvement, and personal info.

## Personal & Community Envolvement

 **Personal**
  - I am 38 years old and I enjoy as much outdoor activites as I do with development.
  - If I could have anything, and money was not a concern, I would have an off-grid, but on-line lifestyle. Contradictory, absolutely, but I feel the enjoyment of being self sufficent only helps build on the skills necessary to be a good problem solver, team player, and positive thinker.

**Community**
 - I participate in an instructor led development community, Woodstock Developers Group [WDG](https://woodstock.dev).
 - We have weekly in-person and virtual meetings. I tutor members where my strengths are, and I participate in groups to continue to learn daily.
 - Our veteran instructor takes 'real world' approach in our project/software development lifecycle utilizing SCRUM and AGILE.
 - We encourage monthly meetups and practice outside of class. 

## Skills
